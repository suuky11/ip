                Pongal, also called Tamizhar Thirunaal (festival of Tamils) or Makara Sankranti elsewhere in India, a four-day harvest festival is one of the most widely celebrated festivals throughout Tamil Nadu.
                 The Tamil language saying Thai Pirandhal Vazhi Pirakkum – literally meaning, the birth of the month of Thai will pave way for new opportunities – is often quoted with reference to this festival. 
                 The first day, Bhogi Pongal is celebrated by throwing away and destroying old clothes and materials by setting them on fire to mark the end of the old and emergence of the new. 
                 The second day, Surya Pongal is the main day which falls on the first day of the tenth Tamil month of Thai (14 January or 15 January in the western calendar). 
                 On the third day, Maattu Pongal is meant to offer thanks to the cattle, as they provide milk and are used to plough the lands.
                 Jallikattu, a bull-taming contest, marks the main event of this day. 
                 Aanganallur is famous for its Jallikattu contest usually held on the third day of Pongal. 
                 During this final day, Kaanum Pongal – the word kaanum, means  in Tamil. 
                 In 2011 the Madras High Court Bench ordered the cockfight at Santhapadi and Modakoor Melbegam villages permitted during the Pongal festival while disposing of a petition filed attempting to ban the cockfight.
                 The first month in the Tamil calendar is Chittirai and the first day of this month in mid-April is celebrated as Tamil New Year.
                 The Thiruvalluvar calendar is 31 years ahead of the Gregorian calendar, i.e. Gregorian 2000 is Thiruvalluvar 2031. 
                 Aadi Perukku is celebrated on the 18th day of the Tamil month Aadi, which celebrates the rising of the water level in the river Kaveri. 
                 Apart from the major festivals, in every village and town of Tamil Nadu, the inhabitants celebrate festivals for the local gods once a year and the time varies from place to place. 
                 Most of these festivals are related to the goddess Maariyamman, the mother goddess of the rain.
                 Other major Hindu festivals including Deepavali (Death of Narakasura), Ayudha Poojai, Saraswathi Poojai (Dasara), Ayya Vaikunda Avataram, Krishna Jayanthi and Vinayaka Chathurthi are also celebrated. 
                 Eid ul-Fitr, Bakrid, Milad un Nabi, Muharram are celebrated by Muslims whereas Christmas, Good Friday, Easter are celebrated by Christians in the state.
                 Mahamagam a bathing festival at Kumbakonam in Tamil Nadu is celebrated once in 12 years. 
                 People from all the corners of the country come to Kumbakonam for the festival.
                 This festival is also called Kumbamela of South.
