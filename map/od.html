              Since its earliest known history, the land that roughly corresponds to present-day Odisha has gone by various names, most notably Utkala (or Okkala), Kalinga, and Odra Desha (or Oddaka), which appeared in ancient literature as designations for particular tribes. The ancient Greeks knew the latter two groups as Kalingai and Oretes. Those names eventually became identified with specific territories.
              At the dawn of Indian history, Kalinga was already a famous and formidable political power. Buddhist sources refer to the rule of King Brahmadatta in Kalinga at the time of the Buddhaâ€™s death, sometime between the 6th and the 4th century BCE. In the 4th century BCE the first Indian empire builder, Mahapadma Nanda, founder of the Nanda dynasty, conquered Kalinga, but the Nanda rule was short-lived. In 260 BCE the Mauryan emperor Ashoka invaded Kalinga and fought one of the greatest wars of ancient history. He then renounced war, became a Buddhist, and preached peace and nonviolence in and outside India. In the 1st century BCE the Kalinga emperor Kharavela conquered vast territories that collectively came to be called the Kalinga empire.
              In the 1st century CE Kalinga emerged as a maritime power. Its overseas activities possibly involved the establishment in the 8th century of the Shailendra empire on the Southeast Asian island of Java (now in Indonesia). Kalinga was ruled by the powerful Bhauma-Kara dynasty during the 8th, 9th, and 10th centuries, followed by the Soma kings until the 11th century. Construction of the 11th-century temple of Lingaraja at Bhubaneshwar, the greatest Shaiva monument of India, was begun by the Soma king Yayati.
