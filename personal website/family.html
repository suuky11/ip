<p>
Families are an integral part of one’s life. It does not matter if you have a small or big family, as long as you have one. 
A family serves as the first school to the child where one learns about various things. 
The basic knowledge about one’s culture and identity comes from their family only. 
In other words, you are a reflection of your family. 
All the good habits and manners one has incorporated are from their family only.

<h3 style="font-family:times new roman;color:black;text-align:left">
    <p>
        My mother's name is Mrs Parameshwari
        Although she is not physically very strong she faces every hurdle of her life and of the family too. 
        She motivates me to be like her and never submit in difficult times. 
        Above all, my mother encourages me to improve my all-round skills and studies. 
        She motivates me to try again and again till I get success in it.
        Additionally, she taught me how to walk, speak, and take care of myself. 
        Similarly, every bigger step that I have taken in my life is all because of my mother. 
        Because, if she hasn’t taught me how to take small steps then I won’t be able to take these bigger step.

<h3 style="font-family:times new roman;color:black;text-align:left">
    <p>
My brother's name is Vignesha
We are just two siblings and I am the youngest to my parents. 
Right from my childhood, my brother has always been my Hero and will always continue to be too. 
I have always looked upon him for all the things that I do.
He is so organized, systematic and has great values and I learn all these values from him.
Though many at times, we do fight and quarrel, he is the best.
One minute we fight like cats and dogs and the next minute we are so much in reunion that I have seen my mom stare at us in surprise!!
